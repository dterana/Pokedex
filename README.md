# A Pokedex  application

V1 : Display of some basics informations about each of the 718 firsts Pokemons.

- IOS 10
- Swift 3
- Alamofire 4.0.1 installed with Carthage
- First page datas are from a CVS file (Creation of a CSV parser)
- Detailed datas are from the V0 of my own [vapor Pokedex API](https://github.com/dterana/Pokedex-API)

The API is hosted on a free Heroku account. Due to free account limitations,the first request to the API can take 15-20 secondes (Time for server instance to wake-up).
